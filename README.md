# fmpy
A python wrapper for the [Financial Modeling Prep](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/) (FMP) API (unofficial). This package focus on providing a simple
and powerful interface for the FMP API. 

For more information on subscription plans and obtaining an API key, please visit the [FMP website](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/pricing/).

## Installation
***
Install fmpy using the pip command:
```
$ pip install fmpy_qi
```

## Usage
***
To begin, you need to create an FmpClient object by passing your API key (provided by FMP) as parameter:
```python
from fmpy.client import FmpClient

client = FmpClient(api_key="YOU_API_KEY")
```

Note that fmpy allow you have to store your API key in as an environment variable under the name 
**FMP_API_KEY** (in that case no need to provide the *api_key* parameter for the FmpClient instantiation)

FmpClient can be initialised with other parameters:

    rate_limit: number of call per minute tolerance (300 by default). This allow to not exceed the rate limit
    timeout: number of seconds to wait a request before raising a timeout (5 by default)
    request_retry: number of request retries before abording (5 by default)

Here is an example:
```python
from fmpy.client import FmpClient

client = FmpClient(api_key="YOU_API_KEY", rate_limit=750, timeout=20, request_retry=1)
# Will not make more than 750 requests per minute, 
# with 20s of timeout and a potential request retry limited to 1
```

## Historical data
```python
from fmpy.client import FmpClient

client = FmpClient(api_key="YOU_API_KEY")
hist_data = client.get_historical_data('TSLA', period='1h', start='2020-01-02 10:00:00', end='2022-06-25 15:00:00')
# Retreive historical 1h candles for Tesla stock between 2020-01-02 10:00:00 and 2022-06-25 15:00:00
# start and end support both "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" and "%Y-%m-%d" time formats
```
